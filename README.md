# FederationSolution

A **GraphQL Federation** project using **HotChocolate** and **Apollo Federation**, backed by **SQL Server**.

This solution demonstrates how to federate multiple subgraphs (Users and Employees) and connect them via Apollo Router.

---

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before running this solution, make sure you have:

- [Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/)
- [Apollo Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/)
- SQL Server (local or remote)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

Run the following SQL script to create and seed the required databases:

```sql
-- Create UserDb
CREATE DATABASE UserDb;
GO
USE UserDb;
GO
CREATE TABLE [Users] (
  UserId INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  Username NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
GO
INSERT INTO Users (Username) VALUES ('alice'), ('bob');

-- Create EmployeeDb
CREATE DATABASE EmployeeDb;
GO
USE EmployeeDb;
GO
CREATE TABLE Employee (
  EmployeeId INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  UserId INT NOT NULL,
  FirstName NVARCHAR(100),
  LastName NVARCHAR(100)
);
GO
-- Example employee linked to UserId = 1
INSERT INTO Employee (UserId, FirstName, LastName) 
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Anderson');
```


‚öôÔ∏è Install Rover

On Windows PowerShell, run the following to install Rover:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/latest' | iex
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Federation

## OFFLINE
Start the Subgraphs

Run the UserSubgraph project (connects to UserDb).

Run the EmployeeSubgraph project (connects to EmployeeDb).

‚ö†Ô∏è It is recommended to start both Subgraph before proceeding.

Run the Router
The Apollo Router binary is already included under EmployeeSubgraph/Router.

Navigate to the router folder:
```
cd EmployeeSubgraph
cd Router
```

Start the router with:
```
rover dev --supergraph-config supergraph-config.yaml
```

## ONLINE

Generate schema for both subgraph. In the Package Manager Console run this commands.
```
cd EmployeeSubgraph
dotnet run -- schema export --output schema.graphql
```

```
cd UserSubgraph
dotnet run -- schema export --output schema.graphql
```

Publish Schema to the Graph OS Subgraph

Note: This process will upload 2 subgraph into one Supergraph

Set variable first

```
$env:APOLLO_KEY="<your-graphs-apollo-key>" `
$env:APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<your-graph-name@current> `
```

Publish Employee First
```
rover subgraph publish $env:APOLLO_GRAPH_REF --name EmployeesSubgraph --schema "EmployeeSubgraph/schema.graphql" --routing-url http://localhost:5115/graphql
```

Then the UserSubgraph
```
rover subgraph publish $env:APOLLO_GRAPH_REF --name UsersSubgraph --schema "UserSubgraph/schema.graphql" --routing-url http://localhost:5227/graphql
```

Once both subgraphs are published into supergraph it will automatically stitch the schema for both.

START THE ROUTER
This will expose the url 127.0.0.1:5000
```
cd Router
./router --config router-config.yaml
```

After the router is succesfully started. Go to
https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer

and put the router url to the Explorer Endpoint.
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Federated Query
```
query {
  getUser(id: "1") {
    id
    username
    fullName
    recommendedEmployee {
      id
      userId
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```
